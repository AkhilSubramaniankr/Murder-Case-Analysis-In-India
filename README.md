Safe countries bestow multiple social and economic benefits on the individual and larger community.Therefore, crime levels must be controlled.

Amid India’s rapid urbanisation, it is crucial tostudy the various facets of criminality from the city perspective to fostersafe and productive environments

India established the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in 1986, a national system for collecting and collating crime statistics. It provides a fair degree of information on crime, the nature of crime, and crime rates in the country. Given the enormous size of the Indian population and its socioeconomic evolutions, India has a comparatively low crime rate by global standards and its unique context.
